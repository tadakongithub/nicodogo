  <h2>What We Do</h2>
  <img id="bella" src="images/bella.jpg">
  <p>NICO DOGO provides customers with dog-care services such as dog-walking, doggy day care, house sitting, and drop-in visit. It is located in Salinas, CA, and we will take care of dogs that are living not only in Salinas but also in neighboring sities such as Monterey, Marina, Carmel and Castroville. </p>
  <p>Let me introduce myself. My name is Nicole Saldana, and I love dogs more than anything in the world. The photo on the right is me with my dog Bella. I have been raising her since she was a little puppy, and that helped me learn how to train dogs and how to play with dogs. Previously I used to work for two dog-caring companies, Wag Hotel and DogPile, where I got to meet and train so many dogs. Through that experience, I learned that each dog has its own unique personality and how to train and play with dogs based on its individuality.</p>
  <p>All in all, I love dogs so much. I just can't get enough of it. And if you let me take care of your dog, I will appreciate every second of it and will make sure that your doggy have a very good time!</p>

  <h2>My Motto</h2>
  <img src="images/walking.jpg">
  <p>My motto is this:</p>
    <h3>Ready to Play with Your Friend</h3>
  <p>Yes, sometimes a dog trainer needs to be strict to have him/her listen to me. But we also take it seriously for both me and your sog to have a good time and fun time. Who doesn't wanna have fun? We try to make every second of it memorable.</p>
